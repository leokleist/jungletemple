This is a Python web app I made based on the game engine from the later chapters of Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw. 
It uses the web.py  framework to let the user play a short adventure game with a text-based interface.
The game engine in app.py runs a map of different rooms(map.py), organized into classes. 
It does this by serving html pages that use layout.html as a template. I also made automated unit tests for the different components of the web app, to be found in /tests.
